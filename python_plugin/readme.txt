HOW TO USE THE PLUGIN:

1. Run model.py
2. Now we have the hubs, copy the all_hub_genes.csv file to SCION directory, then run START_SCION with app.R calls SCION_hub instead of SCION
3. Copy the output network_hub.txt into the cluster_networks folder
3. Run linking.py to link all the clusters and hub networks
4. Final output will be the combined csv file
